## ðŸš€ About Me
Im a fullstack developer with a background in IT. I've spent the past 2 years providing technical support to clients regarding computer, network, and software application problems. This has given me an inside look at how users interact with software. It also gave me the chance to work with many inteligent and creative developers. I can blame them for giving me the programming itch! I love building beautiful and functional web apps that emphasize clean and modular code. Im a Colorado native and an outdoorsman at heart. After everything we have faced these past couple of years I belive in building software that strives in making our everyday lives easier.

 ## ðŸŒ± Learning
 
 I'm currently taking a deep dive into React and how it works under the hood compared to vanilla JS. I picked up the latest edition of You Don't Know JS Yet! I've become really infatuated with the more profound learnings of Javascript and going beyond the scope of why something works.

## ðŸ”­ Upcoming Projects

 Working on a full stack application that mimics a job board. I recently finished up the backend in Express and utilized TDD for developing the API endpoints and routes. All of the data is stored on a Postgres database. So far it has made for a smooth and straightforward development process with full test coverage. The next phase will be developing the front end in React.
